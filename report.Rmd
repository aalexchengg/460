# Introduction

*Describes the problem you’re tackling, why it is interesting or important. Gives a brief summary of your results (though most of your results will be at the end of your report). *

# Data

*Describes the data you’re using in detail, where you accessed it, along with relevant exploratory data analysis (EDA). You should also include descriptions of any major pre-processing steps.*

**TODO: we should probably include the code that got us runrunrun.csv somewhere in our code submission**

# Methods

*Describes the modeling techniques you chose, their assumptions, justifications for why they are appropriate for the problem, and your plan for comparison/evaluation approaches. Additionally, you will need to describe how you will quantify uncertainty for your estimates of interest, with sufficient descriptions of the approach and justification for why it’s appropriate for your data and problem of interest.*

# Results

*Describes your results. This can include tables and plots showing your results, as well as text describing how your models worked and the appropriate interpretations of the relevant output. I do not want to you to write out the textbook interpretations of all model coefficients! I only want you to interpret the output that is relevant for your question of interest that is framed in the introduction.*

# Discussion

*Gives your conclusions and summarizes what you have learned with regards to your question of interest. Are there any limitations with the approaches you used? What do you think are the next steps to follow-up your project?*
